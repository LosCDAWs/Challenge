# Challenge

We are the team composed by:

- Carlos Aznar (capitán)
- Jason Carneiro
- Elías Carrilo
- Alejandro Rodríguez
- Adrián Blázquez

In this project we discuss how to make three models accurate and precise (one geometric, a decision tree and a GaussianNB). To do so:

# 1. The knowledge domain is analyzed
# 2. Exploratory analysis
# 3. Machine learning model
# 4. Result of the competition
# 5. Presentation discussion
